# MNIST Digit Recognition App using TensorFlow.JS
This app allows a user-drawn input of a single digit number (0-9) and uses a pre-trained TensorFlow model to predict what the digit is.

This was my introduction to machine learning and is the basis behind my 45 minute tech talk. You can view the tech talk at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gjEkcwjJUQ&t=6270s.
I start at 00:51:15. In the tech talk, I go over Convolutional Neural Networks and how to use the MNIST dataset to a fully trained version of this app.

Source of the model: https://github.com/aralroca/MNIST_React_TensorFlowJS. This model has very high accuracy which is why I am using it.

This app uses React-Redux, TensorFlowJS, GraphQL, and MaterialUI.

For a demo, please check out https://tsflowjs-mnist.herokuapp.com/.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To start app:

### Install with "yarn"

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
